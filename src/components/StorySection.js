            Founded in 1985, Sakura has been serving authentic Japanese cuisine
            with a commitment to traditional flavors and modern presentation.
            Our master chefs bring decades of experience from Tokyo's finest
            establishments. <br /> <br />
            We believe in the Japanese philosophy of "omotenashi" - wholehearted
            service that anticipates your needs. Every dish is prepared with the
            utmost care and attention to detail, using only the freshest
            ingredients.
